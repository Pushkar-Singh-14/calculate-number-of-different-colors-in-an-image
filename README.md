How to calculate number of different colors in an image
===================


Our aim is to calculate the number of different colors in an image.
----------


Note:
-------------

If the image is in gray scale then use 
img=cv2.imread(filename,0)

The result will be the same but if in case you wish to see the colors then you will be able to see it in the range of 0-255 instead of [0,0,0]-[255,255,255].
